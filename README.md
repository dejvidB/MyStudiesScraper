### Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to revamp the old-fashioned [website](https://my-studies.uoa.gr) of the Electronic Secretariat of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (EKPA), in order to meet the needs of
the students and to help them by offering the most useful features gathered in a modern mobile-friendly and user-friendly website.

### Features:

- Display all courses organized into categories/directions.
- Highlight all passed and failed courses per semester, as well as the grade for each course.
- Display general information about the student, as provided by their department's secretariat and listed in the relevant services.
